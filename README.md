# knapsack-problem
**Overview :**
This project implements a solution to the knapsack problem using Python and Django. It allows users to add multiple items with specified dimensions (height, width, and length) and multiple capacities. The application efficiently computes the optimal selection of items that fit within the given capacities while maximizing the total value.

**Features :**
Add Items: Users can add multiple items, each with specific dimensions (height, width, length) and value.
Add Capacities: Users can define multiple capacity constraints for the knapsack.
Optimal Selection: The project calculates the optimal combination of items that fit within the defined capacities and maximize the total value.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Django, providing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for managing items and capacities.

**Technologies Used :**
Python: Core programming language for the project.
Django: Web framework for building the application.
HTML/CSS: For the frontend interface.

**Getting Started :**
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
Django 3.x or later
